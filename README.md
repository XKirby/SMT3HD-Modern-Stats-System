# SMT3HD Modern Stats System
A mod for Shin Megami Tensei III Nocture HD that changes the entire Stat system in the game.

Includes the following:
- All of your Stats can go up to 99.
- You gain 3 Stat Points per level. Demons get 3 points auto-distributed per level.
- Intelligence is reintroduced, including Intelligence Incense, though it only drops from the Lucky Tickets.
- Minor tutorial nerfs thanks to Zephhyr's Insaniax mod.
- Multiple formulae have been changed to accomodate the increased limits and Intelligence.
- Hama/Mudo now deal both HP/MP damage, in different amounts, and they only insta-kill on Weakness hits.
- Dark Might/Bright Might are now 50% boosts instead of guaranteed criticals for the critical rate formula. Might is only 25% in comparison.
- Mitamas now grant their Bonuses from a total of 4 different stats instead of just 2.
- All demon stats multiplied by a Stat Scaling value of 2 to accomodate for the increased limits.
- Various menu adjustments, including the Stat bars being mostly retooled completely.
- A separate Unity Asset Bundle to use for the Statpoint Bars.
- Reworks of MatthiewPurple's *Cursed Gospel* and *Compendium Discounts* mods, specifically so that they work properly with this mod.
- You can find the Cursed Gospel and Stat Incense items for sale in the final shop of the game. Go nuts.
- Even more stuff I probably forgot.

### How to Install
- Install SMT3HD from your Steam Account.
- Install MelonLoader v0.7 onto SMT3HD.
- Put the included Asset Bundle for the Statpoint Bars in smt3hd's smt3hd_Data\StreamingAssets\PC folder.
- Put "ModernStatsSystem.dll" in MelonLoader's Mods folder.

### NOTES
- Don't play on savefiles created without using this mod, as there will be issues.
- Incompatible with the previously mentioned *Cursed Gospel* and *Compendium Discounts* mods since they had to be manually included.
- Unfortunately, this will not be compatible with the upcoming overhaul mod by Zephhyr, Insaniax. Instead, he's going to partially incorporate my addtions/changes to his mod in a way that works for him.
- Quality of Death by MatthiewPurple is compatible as I've been personally testing my mod with QoD locally.
- ~~The formula for Magic Damage is kinda nutty, making Ragnarok from Surt ***ridiculously overpowered***. It's still survivable, but expect to go in there with either resistance or immunities, it hurts.~~ This has mostly been addressed.
- *This really wasn't planned to be an entire rebalance mod.* I really just wanted to see if I could increase the stat caps first, but then adding Intelligence back in, among other things, kinda just happened. With this in mind, I will not be rebalancing much more with this, if anything.

### Credits
- X Kirby, the developer of the mod. I spent about 2 or 3 months worth of near-constant work on this thing.
- The SMT Modding Discord. They had a great amount of information and helped me get started with making this.
- MatthiewPurple, for both the mods I included as well as for making his own mods open-source. Thanks for the help!
- Zephhyr, for both code snippets as well as the massive amount of information gathered through the work done on his own mod. Thanks for the help, and I look forward to Insaniax!
- Ralsei and Monsoon from the SMT Modding Discord, for helping me with testing as well as ideas and various math formulae. Gonna be honest, this wouldn't be as stable without the help. Thanks!
