# SMT3HD Modern Stats System
A mod for Shin Megami Tensei III Nocture HD that changes the entire Stat system in the game.

Includes the following:
- All of your Stats can go to 100.
- You gain 2 Stat Points per level. Demons get 2 points auto-distributed per level.
- Int is reintroduced (albeit a little bit lazily).
- Certain formulas have been changed to accomodate the increased limits and Int.
- All demon stats multiplied by how many Points you gain per level to accomodate for the new values.
- Various menu adjustments, including the Statpoint bars being mostly retooled completely.
- A separate Unity Asset Bundle to use for the Statpoint bar backgrounds.

### How to Install
- Install SMT3HD from your Steam Account.
- Install MelonLoader v0.7 onto SMT3HD.
- Put the included Asset Bundle for the background bar in smt3hd's smt3hd_Data\StreamingAssets\PC folder.
- Put "modern-stats-system.dll" in MelonLoader's Mods folder.

NOTE: Don't play on existing savefiles.
