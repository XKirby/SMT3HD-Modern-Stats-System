# SMT3HD Modern Stats System
A mod for Shin Megami Tensei III Nocture HD that changes the entire Stat system in the game.

Includes the following:

- You gain 3 Stat Points per level. Demons get 3 points auto-distributed per level.
- Intelligence is reintroduced.
- Certain formulas have been changed to accomodate the increased limits and Intelligence.
- All demon stats multiplied by a Stat Scaling value of 2 to accomodate for the increased limits.
- Various menu adjustments, including the Stat bars being mostly retooled completely.
- A separate Unity Asset Bundle to use for the Statpoint Bars.
