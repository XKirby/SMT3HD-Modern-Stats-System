# SMT3HD Modern Stats System
A mod for Shin Megami Tensei III Nocture HD that changes the entire Stat system in the game.

Includes the following:
- All of your Stats can go up to 99.
- You gain 3 Stat Points per level. Demons get 3 points auto-distributed per level.
- Intelligence is reintroduced.
- Certain formulas have been changed to accomodate the increased limits and Intelligence.
- All demon stats multiplied by how many Points you gain per level to accomodate for the new values.
- Various menu adjustments, including the Stat bars being mostly retooled completely.
- A separate Unity Asset Bundle to use for the Statpoint Bars.

### How to Install
